- destructuring bind
- put macros in another namespace so they never hit eval
- compiler:
    - include
        - use import instead, include is evil
    - bind free variables on lambda lift
        - if vars themselves are parameters, then can't assign in outer scope
        - use _env_fname mechanism for access to outer scopes
        - still a problem assigning to outer function parameters
    - tail recursion
        - same exception mechanism, analyse call graph for potential tail recursion
        - directly map some cases to loops
    - use of nonlocal for assignments to enclosing variables
        - encapsulate scope vars in _env_fname object, which we can assign to with impunity
    - print multiple parameters
        - use exec
